    Analyze the provided notes to determine if they meet the requirements for a high-quality note, as outlined below. Follow these steps for each requirement to ensure no details are missed:

    1. **Verify Presence**: Check if the information is explicitly stated (e.g., "2-3 PNF on shoulders"), implicitly provided (e.g., 'knots' as tightness, 'stress' as a reason for tension), or completely absent. Use the provided context to interpret abbreviations (e.g., 'PNF' as Proprioceptive Neuromuscular Facilitation, 'HF' as hip flexors, 'hammies' as hamstrings, 'HW' as homework) and terms (e.g., 'tight spots' as imbalances).
    2. **Assess Sufficiency**: Consider partial or implicit information sufficient unless the requirement explicitly demands a clear statement (e.g., a reason for no homework). For homework, if no tasks or reason for not assigning them is mentioned, treat it as missing.
    3. **Generate Questions**: Create a concise, non-redundant question only for requirements that are completely missing or unclear. Avoid questions for requirements with partial or implicit information (e.g., a list of muscle groups for the next session). Do not ask any Question regarding MAPS

    Return a JSON object with a single field, "questions", containing a list of questions (strings). If all requirements are met, return an empty list ([]). Thoroughly review the context and notes before generating questions to ensure accurate interpretation of all details.

    - Requirements for a Quality Note:
    1. Actions Taken: Describes the stretching techniques (e.g., PNF, static, dynamic), muscle groups targeted, or exercises performed, including any details like duration, cycles, or range of motion (ROM).
    2. Purpose: States or implies the goals or reasons for the actions, such as reducing tightness, improving flexibility, addressing imbalances, or managing pain/stress, as defined in the context.
    3. Next Session Plan: Lists specific muscle groups, techniques, or periodization phase (e.g., Foundation, Active, Performance) planned for the next session.
    4. Homework: Specifies any stretching or mobility tasks assigned to the client, or provides a clear reason why no homework was assigned (e.g., lack of time, client preference). If neither tasks nor a reason is mentioned, consider this requirement unmet.

def format_notes(notes):

    The notes:
    {notes}

    Organize the StretchLab Flexologist session notes into a structured yet expressive SOAP-style format. Maintain the original tone, flow, and personality of the note, but reorganize it to be clear and structured. Keep the storytelling style where possible while ensuring the content is concise, professional, and aligned with SOAP documentation used in physical therapy.

    Do not rephrase excessively or make the note sound robotic — instead, enhance readability, structure, and clarity while preserving the intent and voice of the Flexologist.
      # Steps:
      1. What was done in the session:
         - Identify the phase of periodization (Foundation, Active, or Performance).
         - Retain the Flexologist's natural tone describing the work done, key stretches, muscles targeted, and observed client responses.
         - Include details like class/session/logging number if mentioned..
      2. Why the actions were performed:
         - Keep the reasoning narrative-style but clarify the purpose of the techniques (e.g., improving range of motion, reducing muscle guarding, restoring balance).
      3. Future plans:
         - Outline the next steps or focus areas in a natural yet structured tone.
         - Include homework, self-care, or activity recommendations if provided.
         - Suggest additional lifestyle advice if applicable.
      4. Identify and Highlight Missing Information:
         - Explicitly list what key elements (Class, Phase, rationale, plan, etc.) were not mentioned.
      5. Suggestions for Improvement:
         - Offer constructive suggestions to improve note-taking, focusing on detail, clarity, and progression tracking.
      # Output Format:
        Return a JSON object with a single field "notes" that contains an array of formatted expressive note objects using the fields below:

      {{
        "notes": [
                {{

                "Considerations": "Contextual insights or external contributing factors affecting flexibility or performance.",

                }}
            ]
      }}

      Notes:

        - Only include a field if it was mentioned in the original notes.

        - Preserve emotional or descriptive language (e.g., “Client felt more open through the hips after deep PNF work”).

        - Keep the output structured but authentically human — as if a Flexologist were documenting naturally but clearly.
